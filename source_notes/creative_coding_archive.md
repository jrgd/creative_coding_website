This is a very quickly put-together archive for the Creative Coding courses I built over the years at ALBA Ecole des Beaux Arts de Beyrouth. It also includes more recent experiments with tools: making images, self-generating, etc.

# Creative coding and visual experiments

This website/repository/archive is itself an experiment.
It concatenates a few projects and experiments available otherwise as GitHub repositories. 

### Website building
It's using some deployment tools:
- ```yarn clone_repo``` this will clone the repositories listed for the archive in the website structure
- ```yarn build``` will parse the source directories, copy repositories, generate files (html) from markdown notes and create zip files
### Website hosting
For now, it's using Github hosted pages to serve the ./docs content. This content is parsed/generated by the build command above
### Website content
The website has two main parts for now:
- the ongoing experiments chronologically numbered
- the notes investigating aspects of those experiments as well as research for future topics and exercices.

The project is an ongoing research seminar.
