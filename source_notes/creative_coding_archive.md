This is a very quickly put-together archive for the Creative Coding courses I built over the years at ALBA Ecole des Beaux Arts de Beyrouth. It also includes more recent experiments with tools: making images, self-generating, etc.

# Creative coding and visual experiments

This website/repository/archive is itself an experiment. It is an ongoing research seminar. It concatenates a few projects and experiments available otherwise as GitHub repositories. 

The topics and subjects I started to explore and would like to investigate more and more in the future:
- designing tools to design; create your own tools
- coding tools, interfaces
	- text editor
	- servers, infrastructure
	- front end language
		- css, html
		- javascript, jQuery 
		- three js
	- back end
		- php
		- nodes 
- generating images, different formats: bitmap, vector, 3d, animation and films
- creating processes and behaviours 

Context: what this website is
- a growing collection of experiments and quick explorations of ideas and thoughts experiments
- an interactive sketch book
- a tool to share creative coding courses content, context and reflexions with my students
- a primer into code for non-engineering-oriented persons

### Website content
The website has two main parts for now:
- the ongoing experiments chronologically numbered
- the notes investigating aspects of those experiments as well as research for future topics and exercices.
### Website notes: deploying
- individual experiment repository are stored publicly on GitHub
- only the first line of the readme.md is used to generate the list of experiments
- they must be added one by one
	- each experiment got its own repository
### Website building
It's using some deployment tools:
- ```yarn clone_repo``` this will clone the repositories listed for the archive in the website structure
- ```yarn build``` will parse the source directories, copy repositories, generate files (html) from markdown notes and create zip files
### Website hosting
For now, it's using Github hosted pages to serve the ./docs content. This content is parsed/generated by the build command above
