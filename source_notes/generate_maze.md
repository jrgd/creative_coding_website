# Generating maze shapes


- using ASCII characters, like:
&#9484;
&#9487;
&#9491;
&#9507;
&#9515;
&#9531;
&#9499;
&#9523;
&#9547;

I see some connections in between creating an ascii map for a text-based game and writing a story (cf experiments 050); there are also visual/formal links with a design tool. I want to investigate further all these connections and how they can be harvested.
