  <h1>Creative Coding / Visual Experiments</h1>
  <h2>an ongoing coding/research seminar</h2><div class='navigation'>
  <a href='./index.html'>Index</a> | <a href='./notes.html'>Notes</a>
</div><p>This is a very quickly put-together archive for the Creative Coding courses I built over the years at ALBA Ecole des Beaux Arts de Beyrouth. It also includes more recent experiments with tools: making images, self-generating, etc.</p>
<h1>Creative coding and visual experiments</h1>
<p>Github repository for this website: <a href="https://github.com/jrgd/creative_coding_website/">https://github.com/jrgd/creative_coding_website/</a>; there you can access the tools to build this static website from a bunch of repositories, markdown files and images.</p>
<p>This website/repository/archive is itself an experiment. It is an ongoing research seminar. It concatenates a few projects and experiments available otherwise as GitHub repositories. </p>
<p>Context: what this website is</p>
<ul>
<li>a growing collection of experiments and quick explorations of ideas and thoughts experiments</li>
<li>a tool to share creative coding courses content, context and reflexions with my students; assignments, ideas to develop, visual research: how do we create a similar image using only code?</li>
<li>a primer into code for non-engineering-oriented persons
We generally use pseudo-code to play with variables and loops, logic structure, explain concepts, discover languages and dig in the depth of how to generate and manipulate bitmaps, vectors, animation, 3d, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The topics and subjects we started to explore and some I would like to investigate more in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>designing tools to design; create your own tools</li>
<li>coding tools, interfaces
<ul>
<li>text editor</li>
<li>servers, infrastructure</li>
<li>front end language
<ul>
<li>css, html (rediscovering the basics)</li>
<li>javascript, jQuery </li>
<li>three js, vr/xr, stl (3d printing models created by code)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>back end
<ul>
<li>php</li>
<li>nodes </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>generating images, different formats: bitmap, vector, 3d, animation and films</li>
<li>creating cognitive processes, object behaviours and reactive interactions that enrich the meaning being transmitted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Website content</h3>
<p>The website has two main parts for now:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ongoing experiments chronologically numbered</li>
<li>the notes investigating aspects of those experiments as well as research for future topics and exercices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Website notes: deploying</h3>
<ul>
<li>individual experiment repository are stored publicly on GitHub</li>
<li>only the first line of the readme.md is used to generate the list of experiments</li>
<li>they must be added one by one
<ul>
<li>each experiment got its own repository</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Website building</h3>
<p>It's using some deployment tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>yarn clone_repo</code> this will clone the repositories listed for the archive in the website structure</li>
<li><code>yarn build</code> will parse the source directories, copy repositories, generate files (html) from markdown notes and create zip files</li>
</ul>
<h3>Website hosting</h3>
<p>For now, it's using Github hosted pages to serve the ./docs content. This content is parsed/generated by the build command above</p>
