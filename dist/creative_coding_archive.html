  <h1>Creative Coding / Visual Experiments</h1>
  <h2>an ongoing coding/research seminar</h2><div class='navigation'>
  <a href='./index.html'>Home</a>
</div><p>This is a very quickly put-together archive for the Creative Coding courses I built over the years at ALBA Ecole des Beaux Arts de Beyrouth. It also includes more recent experiments with tools: making images, self-generating, etc.</p>
<h1>Creative coding and visual experiments</h1>
<p>This website/repository/archive is itself an experiment.
It concatenates a few projects and experiments available otherwise as GitHub repositories. </p>
<h3>Website building</h3>
<p>It's using some deployment tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>yarn clone_repo</code> this will clone the repositories listed for the archive in the website structure</li>
<li><code>yarn build</code> will parse the source directories, copy repositories, generate files (html) from markdown notes and create zip files
<h3>Website hosting</h3>
<p>For now, it's using Github hosted pages to serve the ./dist content. This content is parsed/generated by the build command above</p>
<h3>Website content</h3>
<p>The website has two main parts for now:</p></li>
<li>the ongoing experiments chronologically numbered</li>
<li>the notes investigating aspects of those experiments as well as research for future topics and exercices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is an ongoing research seminar.</p></body>
