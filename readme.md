The topics and subjects I started to explore and would like to explore in the future:
- designing tools to design; create your own tools
- coding tools, interfaces
	- text editor
	- servers, infrastructure
	- front end language
		- css, html
		- javascript, jQuery 
		- three js
	- back end
		- php
		- nodes 
- generating images, different formats: bitmap, vector, 3d, animation and films
- creating processes and behaviours 

Context: what this website/collection is
- a growing collection of experiments and quick exploration of ideas; thoughts experiments
- a sort of an interaction sketch book
- a tool to share creative coding courses content, context and reflexions with my students
- a primer into code for non-engineering-oriented persons


Notes on deploying this
- individual experiment repository are stored publicly on GitHub
- only the first line of the readme.md is used to generate the list of experiments
- they must be added one by one
	- each experiment got its own repository


```yarn build```
	- this will clone the repositories if they are not yet there
